     \coloredbullet\ %
     Developed a novel modification to a quaternion-based control system that optimizes control allocation within a quadrotor's actuator constraints to improve its stability and performance.
    \smallskip 
    \coloredbullet\ %
     Modeled and simulated a quadrotor's attitude and translational dynamics in MATLAB/Simulink to quantify the stability and performance improvements of the proposed control system.
     \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Adapted and extended existing C++ code architectures to facilitate prototype implementation and performed hardware-in-the-loop simulations, using Gazebo/ROS for testing.

    \coloredbullet\ %
     Independently built an open-source web application that performs advanced Monte Carlo calculations for options trading, receiving praise from the trading community for its simplicity and accessibility.
     \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Front and back-end development using the React and Flask (Python) frameworks, respectively. These services were containerized using Docker Compose to enable scalability in the software architecture.
     \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Used Python optimization techniques to reduce calculation times for a fast API that can serve thousands of users per second. Load balancing in AWS was incorporated to ensure fault-tolerance and reliability of the application.
     \smallskip
     \coloredbullet\ %
     Integrated the Azure Active Directory B2C service for secure user authentication and convenient identity management.
